        "treatment": [
          "Remove and destroy infected plant parts, such as leaves and twigs, to prevent the spread of Apple scab.",
          "Apply fungicides at the appropriate times, following label instructions carefully to effectively control the disease.",
          "Practice good orchard sanitation by regularly cleaning up fallen leaves, fruit, and other debris that can harbor the pathogen.",
          "Plant disease-resistant apple varieties to reduce the likelihood of Apple scab infections and minimize the need for chemical treatments.",
          "Apply sulfur or lime-sulfur sprays during the early stages of tree growth to protect against Apple scab spores.",
          "Use horticultural oils during dormant seasons to control overwintering Apple scab spores and reduce early season infections.",
          "Ensure proper tree spacing to promote good air circulation, which helps to keep the foliage dry and less conducive to fungal growth.",
          "Regularly monitor your apple trees for signs of Apple scab, such as lesions on leaves and fruit, and take immediate action if symptoms are detected.",
          "Implement a proper pruning schedule to maintain tree health, improve sunlight penetration, and increase airflow, reducing the chances of infection.",
          "Clean up and dispose of fallen leaves and fruit at the end of the growing season to eliminate sources of Apple scab inoculum for the next season."
